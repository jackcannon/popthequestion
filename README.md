# Pop the Question
[Play it here!](http://www.popthequestion.uk)

## About
I made this small game to propose to my girlfriend. I made it during my lunch breaks at work so that she wouldn't see at home. It started out on codepen, but then as I added more and more stuff, I eventually moved it over.

## Idea
I was inspired by a post I saw on Hacker News a while back, about a guy who created an iOS puzzle game in order to propose to his girlfriend, and asked her to 'test' it. I thought it was a neat idea, and as I'm always creating silly little games and websites, it would be the perfect delivery mechanism for my proposal.

My idea of how the game would work came from wanting to create a 'Pop the Question' game. What do you usually pop? Balloons. So if balloons equated to questions, then the game would be you 'popping questions'. However, I couldn't name the game 'Pop the Question' straight up, as she'd see right through it, so when the game first loads, the title reads 'Burst the Balloon'. Then, by the end, the title has changed to the real name: Pop the Question.

All the answers/questions relate to us as a couple, starting out vague (we're both big fans of Andy Murray and Arsenal FC), and gradually getting more personal (e.g. where we met).
